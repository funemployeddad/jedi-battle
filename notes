- make an actual user class for registering/login and then let them make many jedi
- once logged in, then use the drop-down to select which jedi you want to use
- make a 'bacta_tank' action in teh jedi controller and then make a partial that is rendered if they click the 'use bacta tank' button on their jedi show page which resets their hp to max
  - ?? make hp a non-enterable item on creation. every jedi starts with the same amount?
